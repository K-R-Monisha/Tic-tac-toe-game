Tic-Tac-Toe Game

🎮 About the Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

🛠️ How to Play

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

Player X moves first, followed by Player O.

Players enter the row (1-3) and column (1-3) to place their mark.

If a player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win! 🎉

If all spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
